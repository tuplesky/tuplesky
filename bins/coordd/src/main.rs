//! `coordd`: parse strict configuration, report the composed roles and
//! the readiness requirements, and run. With `--check` it validates and
//! exits; otherwise it opens the store it already has, binds the
//! configured listeners and stays up. Consensus and serving arrive with
//! the later integration tasks, so a started process reports `Live` and
//! never `Ready`. Everything it prints is secret-safe.
//!
//! `coordd init` is separate on purpose: it creates a node's first
//! generation, and nothing else ever does. A daemon that created a store
//! when it failed to find one would turn a lost disk, an unmounted
//! volume or a mistyped path into a fresh, empty, valid node -- which
//! would then vote, having forgotten everything it had promised.
//!
//! Initialization also pins the genesis manifest it was run under, and
//! every later start requires the same one (see `genesis`): the manifest
//! is a file, and a node that re-adopted whatever the file said on each
//! start would vote by the operator's latest edit rather than by the
//! configuration every replica agreed on.
